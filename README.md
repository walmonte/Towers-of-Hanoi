# Overview
This program solves the Towers of Hanoi problem using vectors. Improvement, like using a recursive solution, will be made in the future. 

## Details
Towers of Hanoi is a famous puzzle created by a french mathematician in the late 20th centuty. It consists of three towers (A,B,C) and an 'n' number of rings, determined by the user, of different sizes placed in ascending order on tower A.

The goal is to move all rings from tower A to tower B without moving the same ring twice in a row or placing any ring on top of one of lesser size.
